What does it mean for projects that are still using it? Will someone pull the plug and everything will stop working on that day? In this talk, I will discuss the future of Python 2, the dangers of using the unsupported version of Python and opportunities for those who want to migrate to Python 3. But, I will also explain what choice you have if you really can\'t move to Python 3 yet. This is not a “how we migrated to Python 3 at Foo company” type of talk. There are many other talks that explain the migration process and outcome in various companies. I want to take a different approach and focus on comparing the options that you have: rewriting your Python project, migrating it, staying on Python 2 or moving to a different implementation, like PyPy (together with pros and cons of each). And for those of you who decide to migrate to Python 3, I will explain how to prepare to this kind of task, what tools and techniques can help you and what problems you might encounter.","date":"09.16(Mon) 13:40 - 14:25","level":"Intermediate","language":"EN","materials":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a_TEjCl8NQ","tag":"Best practices"}]')},436:function(t,e,o){"use strict";o.r(e);o(52);var n={asyncData:function(t){var e=t.params;return{session:o(409).find((function(t){return t.id===e.id}))}},validate:function(t){var e=t.params;return e.id&&/^\w+$/.test(e.id)}},r=o(5),component=Object(r.a)(n,(function(){var t=this.$createElement;return(this._self._c||t)("div",[this._v("\n  "+this._s(this.session)+"\n")])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=component.exports}}]);
